# Main Text
To demonstrate a potential methodology for discerning the use of connectives in context, we modeled connective learning using a random forest approach. Random forests are an ensemble model that aggregates many decision trees. A decision tree is a series of binary decisions that classifies data into two or more classes. The order and structure of these decisions can be learned from data. Here, we randomly subsample subsets of the annotated CHILDES corpus as training data and then test on the remaining data. 

## Discerning XOR-IOR
From 300 annotated examples labeled as either IOR or XOR, we use intonation and consistency to separate the two categories. \newline

If intonation is rise-fall, XOR. \newline
If inconsistent, XOR. \newline
Otherwise, IOR \newline

## Discerning XOR-IOR-AND
From 300 annotated examples labeled IOR, XOR, or AND, we use intonation, speech act, consistency, and annotation to separate them. \newline

If Annotation is AND, AND \newline
If intonation is rise-fall, XOR \newline
If intonation is rising and inconsistent, XOR \newline
If intonation is rising and consistent, IOR \newline
If intonation is flat and speech act options/defex/unconditional, AND \newline
If intonation is flat and other speech act, XOR \newline

## Discerning Everything 
From 300 annotated examples labeled IOR, XOR, AND, NPQ, XNOR, or NOR, we use intonation, speech act, consistency, utterance type, and annotation to separate them. \newline

If Annotation is AND, AND \newline
IF intonation is rise-fall, XOR \newline
If intonation is rising and inconsistent, XOR \newline
If intonation is rising and consistent, IOR \newline
If intonation is flat and speech act is (unconditional or repair or directive description), NPQ \newline
If intonation is flat and speech act is defex, AND \newline
If intonation is flat and speech act is (conditional, identification, clarification, or directive), XOR \newline
If intonation is flat and speech act is (description, options, preference), ???
\newline
