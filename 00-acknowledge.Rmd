This dissertation is about *or*, but first, I will take a moment to focus on *thanks*. I would like to thank the many people who, through the years, have selflessly and generously offered me their knowledge, skills, time, kindness, and support. Words do not do justice to what they have done for me, but in thanking them here, I hope I succeed in expressing my gratitude. I will never forget the influence they have had on my development, and will always strive to pay their kindness and generosity forward.

I would like to first thank the Stanford Linguistics department, who trusted me and supported my learning and growth in the past six years. Undoubtedly, it has been an honor to know every single member of the Stanford linguistics community. I would like to especially thank my principal advisor, Eve Clark. I feel extremely lucky to have had Eve as my advisor and it will always be my honor to have been her last (official) doctoral student. Academic work can sometimes feel too abstract, but Eve's advice always drew me back to the critical points of examining linguistic development. I can still hear Eve say: "But what is the context of use?" The readers of this dissertation will surely notice Eve's immense influence on its content, as well as my research more broadly.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Mike Frank for his excellent and kind mentorship. Mike's guidance was crucial in shaping my research on disjunction and logical words. Among many other topics, Mike introduced me to open science and best practices in experimental research. His ideas and teachings in this area have had a deep and lasting impact on my own research and thinking. I strive to challenge and support students just as he has done for me.

Through his incisive comments and criticism, Chris Potts has been extremely influential in shaping the direction and approach of this dissertation, as well as my own thinking on semantics and pragmatics. I will always be grateful for the example that he set for me in critically assessing theories, especially those of my own. I would like to also thank Ellen Markman, whose helpful comments on earlier drafts of this dissertation helped shape its logical flow. Many thanks to Thomas Icard for sharing his comments and deep insights with me so generously.

My first research project as a graduate student examined differential object marking in Persian. At times, it seemed frustratingly impenetrable. The advances I made in that project and in others would not have been possible without the helpful insights of Paul Kiparsky and Cleo Condoravdi. I am grateful to both for what they taught me. Cleo's contagious passion for crosslinguistic research in semantics and pragmatics pushed me to continue my research on Persian function words. Her careful and rigorous work, as well as extensive knowledge of the field, showed me the kind of semanticist I would like to be. I will always be grateful to her for that.

Every aspect of my graduate education has benefited from the selfless and kind advice of Beth Levin. She was the person who made sure that our graduate education at Stanford proceeded as best as it could have. I cannot thank her enough. I would also like to thank my undergraduate advisors, Inbal Arnon and Andrew Koontz-Garboden, who set me on the path to graduate education. I am and will always be deeply grateful to them. I would also like to thank the wonderful staff at Stanford Linguistics: Ann Marie Pettigrew, Gabriela Magana, Sue Learned-Driscoll, Rebekah Quijas, Jeanne Sue, and Hana Wilson. I will truly miss our conversations in the department office. 

My research is deeply indebted to the people at the Bing Nursery School. It is fair to say that the biggest challenge in developmental research is methodological: how can we best capture children's knowledge and mental state? Experimental environment is the key. If children feel nervous or confused about what is going on in the study, we won't be able to capture what we like to know about them. The staff and teachers at the Bing Nursery School create the right environment for research where children feel at home, and researchers feel at ease while running their studies. For this, as well as their generous help and support with my research, I would like to thank Jennifer Winters, Beth Wise, Chia-wa Yeh, and all the kind teachers and staff at the Bing Nursery School.

During my time at Stanford, I have had the pleasure of teaching undergraduate students and serving as the linguistics undergraduate mentor. My teaching and mentorship helped me meet brilliant students and researchers such as Akshay Jaggi and Kutay Serova, who joined me later as research assistants. Akshay played a major role in developing annotation categories for this dissertation and later computational modeling of the annotation data. Kutay was extremely helpful in creating the annotation dataset and help with the annotation as well. I would like to thank them both. I would also like to thank Salma Sebt for her generous help with the annotation study.

A great part of my learning was due to the brilliant, kind, and supportive friends that I had during my graduate education. I am extremely grateful to each and every one of them: Roey Gafter, Natalia Silveira, James Collins, Lelia Glass, Sharese King, Katherine Hilton, Bonnie Krejci, Tim Dozat, Phil Crone, Teresa Pratt, Sunwoo Jeong, Prerna Nadathur, Sara Kessler, Rob Voigt, and Sebastian Schuster. I truly hope they know how much I have learned from them. The saddest part about graduation was knowing that I wonâ€™t be able to see them every day and share our ideas. I would like to also thank my dear friends, Sobhan Hajitarkhani and Leila Alapour, who always made sure I was happy and sane. My last year at Stanford was incredibly memorable thanks to the numerous events and adventures that I embarked upon with my dear Iranian friends on the board of the Persian Student Association: Amir Hossein Delgoshaie, Hamed Akhondzadeh, Soroosh Hemmati, Ali Hemmati, and Soheil Esmaeilzadeh. I will miss them dearly as well as our long conversations with fellow Iranian Stanford students.

I am eternally grateful for the sacrifices that my parents have made for my education. All I have achieved and all I will achieve, truly belongs to them. I am also lucky to have the support of my two loving sisters, Fahimeh and Elham, who always bring me joy and laughter. My graduate education meant that I had to leave behind my family back home, often not being able to see them for very long periods of time. This was really hard for me, and for them, despite their jokes that life is a lot easier when I'm not around! Finally I would like to thank Mona Matsumoto-Ryan: for being who she is and for who she has helped me to be.
