# Conclusion {#conclusion}

This dissertation engaged with two questions in the intersection of meaning and development. First, how do children learn the meaning of function words? Second, how do children learn the meaning of a disjunction word like *or* in English? The first question is broad and can be answered by investigating children's acquisition of different types of function words across languages. That is what the second question is about, focusing on the word *or* in English. In addressing the second question, my goal was to engage with the broader question of function word acquisition in children and build on previous research in this area. In this section, I first summarize how this dissertation addressed the narrower question of learning disjunction in English. Then I explain how the findings shed light on the broader question of learning function words.

I started this dissertation with a summary of the research in semantics and pragmatics on disjunction. In language, disjunction can give rise to a number of implications. These implications include truth-functional ones such as inclusivity, exclusivity, and conjunctivity, as well as non-truth-functional ones like ignorance, and indifference. On the face of it, what a disjunction implies may seem arbitrary. Since @grice1989studies, however, decades of research has provided mounting evidence that implications of a disjunction arise systematically through its interaction with other linguistic and sociopragmatic factors that shape the overal interpretation of the utterance. Chapter \@ref(sempragLit) discussed a non-exhaustive list of these factors, including the intonation of the disjunction, the semantic relation of the disjuncts themselves, the linguistic enviornment of the disjunction, as well as the communicative intention of the speaker. The chapter argued that the interpretive factors discovered and discussed in theoretical semantics and pragmatics informs research in child language acuqisition by providing a list of cues that may help children interpret a disjunction and learn the meaning of *or*.  

How often do children hear examples of *or*? Chapter \@ref(corpus) used a larger body of child-directed speech to address this questions. It found that compared to *and*, *or* was relatively rare in child-directed speech. Per thousand words, parents produced about 15 instances of *and* and only 1.5 instances of *or*. The study also found that on average, children produced *or* less often and later than *and*. Per thousand words, children produced about 15 instances of *and* but only 0.5 instances of *or*. Children started producing *and* between 1 to 1.5 years of age, while *or* production started at 1.5 to 2.5 years. Furthermore, children reached their parents rate of *and*-production around 3 years of age, but they did not reach the parents' rate of *or* production in the first six years of their lives. @morris2008logically had suggested that this developmental asymmetry between *and* and *or* is due to the differences in frequency and usage of these connectives in child-directed speech. Chapter \@ref(corpus) provided another possible factor, namely the social and conversational roles of "parents" and "children". Parents and children do not communicate the same types of messages to each other. For example, it is not surprising to hear a parent say "go to your room" to a child. However, a child saying the same phrase to a parent is surprising and unexpected! 

The large scale corpus study found that parents ask more questions from children than children from parents. In addition, the disjunction word *or* is more likely to occur in the context of questions rather than declaratives. Therefore, parents may be producing more instances of *or*, because they ask them more questions. When the study compared the production of *or* in declaratives and questions, we saw that children were closer to the parents' rate of *or* in declaratives. This finding suggests that the asymmetry between *and* and *or* may at least partly be due to the differences in speech acts produced by parents and children, and not necessarily their acquisition of the disjunction word *or*. More generally, since presence or absence of a function word depends on the overal communicative function of the utterance, it is important for production studies to control for the types of speech acts produced by parents and children. Children may not produce a function word at their parents' rate, simply because they do not produce the types of speech acts that the function word is most suitable for. Not reaching the parents' rate of production does not necessarily imply incomplete acquisition. The large scale corpus study of Chapter \@ref(corpus) showed that on average, children start producing the connectives *and* and *or* around 1 to 2 years of age and continue until they reach a relatively steady rate of production around age 4. 

The findings of the large scale corpus study are in-line with comprehension studies that suggest children can interpret both connectives at the age of 4 years. Several studies in the past decade have shown that at age 4, children can interpret *or* as inclusive disjunction [@crain2012emergence]. However, @morris2008logically reported that the vast majority of examples children hear, and in fact produce, receive an exclusive interpretation. How can we reconcile these two findings? How can children learn an inclusive interpretation for *or* if they rarely hear it? I referred to this as the puzzle of learning disjunction. To answer this question, Chapter \@ref(corpus) also provided an annotation study. Examples of *or* were annotated for their interpretations, as well as several other features such as intonation, the semantic relation of the disjuncts, and their communicative functions. The study replicated the finding of @morris2008logically: exclusive interpretations of *or* are more common than the inclusive ones in child-directed speech. However, the study also found that exclusive interpretations are systematically accompanied by certain cues, most notably, a rise-fall intonation or iconsistent disjuncts like "stay or go". When these cues were absent, *or* received an inclusive interpretation. 

From the findings of the annotation study, a learning account emerged that addressed the puzzle of learning disjunction. I referred to this account as the cue-based context-dependent acquisition of *or*. Previous literature on disjunction seem to assume that *or* is mapped to its most likely interpretation observed by the learner. I called this the default account. @morris2008logically found exclusive disjunction to be the most common interpretation of *or* in child-directed speech, and proposed that children initially learn its meaning as exclusive. To support this hypothesis, he showed that *or* is also exclusive in children's early productions. As mentioned before, comprehension studies found that preschool children (in the same age range) are more likely to interpret a disjunction as inclusive than exclusive. How can this be? 

An important property of the default account is that it disregards the context of *or* when learning its meaning. In Chapter \@ref(modeling) I argued that this context-independent mapping of *or* to its meaning is the source of the learning puzzle for disjunction. I suggested that a small change to the default account can solve this problem. Instead of mapping the word *or* directly and context-independently to its interpretations, we can map a disjunction as a whole along with the available contextual cues to an interpretation. This way, it is not *or* that is interpreted as exclusive, but rather *or* with a rise-fall intonation or inconsistent disjuncts. In the absence of these cues, the most likely interpretation of a disjunction would be inclusive. When contextual cues are used to learn the interpretation of a disjunction, the learner can know in what context a disjunction is inclusive and in what contexts exclusive. The modeling exterpiments of  Chapter \@ref(modeling) showed that such a cue-based context-dependent learning is successful in classifying examples of disjunction as inclusive or exclusive. Crucially, inclusive interpretations were more likely in the context of declarative sentences with flat intonation and consistent disjuncts. These are the types of sentences that comprehension studies used to test children's knowledge of disjunction. Therefore, the proposed account shows how children can learn an inclusive interpretation for disjunction from an input dominated by exclusive examples. 

In Chapter \@ref(devoLit), I provided a review of the developmental research on children's comprehension of disjunction. Early studies in 70s and 80s suggested that children and even adults struggle with understanding a disjunction. They either interpret it as exclusive or conjunctive. However, further investigations suggested that conjunctive interpretations may be due to non-linguistic strategies that are deployed when the task is demanding or perhaps confusing to participants. More recent studies within a Gricean framework have suggested that children interpret *or* as inclusive disjunction. However, it is hard to compare the results between recent findings and early ones because they differ along several dimensions. The review concluded that future studies should control for the following factors: complexity of the linguistic stimuli, complexity of the task, ignorance of the speaker, interpretation of the conjunction word (e.g. *and*) in the same task, and finally interpretation of adults in the same task. Chapter \@ref(comprehension) presented a set of experiments with children and adults that controlled for these factors.

In Chapter \@ref(comprehension), I tested adults and children's interpetation of conjunction and disjunction in English existential constructions in the context of a guessing game. In each trial, participants saw a card and a blindfolded character guessed what animals were on the card. For example, the character guessed "there is a cat or a dog" when there was a cat and a dog on the card. Participants were asked to judge if the guess was right. In one set of experiments children and adults provided binary responses of "right" and "wrong"; in another set, ternary responses of "right", "a little right", and "wrong". The binary results found no statistically significant difference between children's and adults' truth judgments. The results of the ternary task only found children to be more accepting of disjunction when both disjuncts were true. For example, when the character guessed "cat or dog" and both animals were on the card, children were more likely to say "right" and adults were more likely to say "a little right". Overall, both adults and children provided inclusive interpretations for disjunction in the existential sentences of the guessing game. The resuts are compatible with the prediciton of the cue-based context-dependent account presented in Chapter \@ref(modeling).

The studies in Chapter \@ref(comprehension) also investigated children's spontaneous feedback to the puppet in the experimental setting. Children's feedback was divided into three categories: judgments (yes/no), descriptions (naming the animals), corrections (focusing what the puppet should have said). The results showed that children provided corrections when the guess was either false or infelicitous. Most notably, in trials where a disjunction like "cat or dog" was used and both animals were on the card, children judged the guess as "right" but provided corrections to the puppet. For example, they said "cat and dog", emphasizing the word *and*. Some also mentioned the word *both*. The analysis of children's linguistic feedback suggested that truth value judgments may underestimate children's linguistic competence. The chapter discussed the methodological challenges in assessing and measuring children's semantic and pragmatic knowledge. 

What does the acquisition of *or* teach us about function words in general? First, the case of *or* in English shows that thoeries of word learning should not ignore the context of form-meaning mapping. Previous approahces to the acquisition of the lexicon often rely on isolating a word form, isolating a meaning, and mapping the form to the meaning. The case of *or* shows that "word form" can extent beyond the word to encompass the intonational contour on the whole disjunciton. It also shows that "meaning" can extend to include the semantic relations of the disjuncts themselves, for example, whether they are consistent or inconsistent. In order to successfully learn the interpretation of *or*, the learner must attend to the cues available in the context of the word. 

The second lesson is methodological. The case of *or* shows that the development of function words is best understood if evidence is gathered from three sources: child-directed speech, children's comprehension, and children's production. In the case of *or*, each source provides invaluable and complementary insight on how children learn the meaning of *or*. Each source individually provides information that may miss crucial aspects of the full development. It is only when all three sources are taken into account and reconciled that a coherent developmental account emerges. Ideally, we construct formal models that use child-directed speech to predict children's comprehension and production at a specific age. The aim of this dissertation was to take a step in this direction. My hope is that future work on similar functions words will extend, improve, and standardize this methodology to result in a general gheory of function word acquisition.
