# Conclusion {#conclusions}


Talk about claims of innateness maybe? Are logical concepts innate? are they any more special than size etc.? 

I asked what constraints and cues aid children's acquisition of function words? 

The general account:
Syntactic bootstrapping constrains the hypothsis space for the function word.
Cues such as intonation, semantics of the content words being combined, the communicative function of the sentence, etc. help the learner in mapping the function word to its meaning.

In case of disjunction:
Syntactic bootstrapping constrains the hypothesis space to the connective meanings.
"syntactic constructions in which two or more units of the same type are combined into a larger unit and still have the same semantic relations with other surrounding elements."
Intonation, disjunct semantics 

* The role of ruotines and common conceptual representations in learning the meaning of function words.
    + Eve's work on spatial prepositions of in/on/under
    + Eve's work on temporal connectives before and after
    + Bloom's work on number words
    + Piantedosi et al on quantifier learning
* Forming interpretations at the top level based on the routines, mapping at the top level, then breaking them down to retrieve word meaning consistent across constructions
* However, mapping should take into account the formal and conceptual environment of mapping
